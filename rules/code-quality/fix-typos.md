# Fix Typos

Automatically detect and suggest fixes for spelling errors in titles, descriptions, code comments, and documentation while learning codebase-specific terminology.

## When to Use This

Apply when changes include:
- Changes to code comments or docstrings
- Updates to README, documentation files, or markdown content
- New or modified titles and descriptions
- String literals in user-facing messages
- Variable/function names that include English words

## How It Works

1. **Read the ENTIRE diff** - Do NOT sample or truncate:
   - **CRITICAL**: You MUST read the complete diff content for every changed file
   - Do NOT just read the top/bottom N lines - typos can appear anywhere in the diff
   - For large diffs, read each file's changes in full before scanning for typos
   - Typos are just as likely in line 500 as in line 5 - partial reads will miss them

2. **Skip auto-generated files**:
   - Check the first 10-20 lines of each file for auto-generation markers
   - Common markers to detect:
     - `// This file is auto-generated`
     - `// DO NOT EDIT - generated by ...`
     - `/* Auto-generated by ... */`
     - `# Generated by ...`
     - `// @generated`
     - `<!-- This file is automatically generated -->`
   - If file is auto-generated → skip entirely, do not scan for typos
   - If unsure, check if file path matches common generated patterns: `*.generated.*`, `codegen/*`, `__generated__/*`

3. **Maintain codebase dictionary**:
   - Build a list of technical terms, product names, and domain-specific vocabulary unique to this codebase
   - Track terms that appear frequently across the codebase (e.g., function names, class names, product features)
   - Examples: proprietary tool names, internal APIs, custom DSL keywords, company-specific acronyms
   - Store in `.gitar/dictionary.json` or similar persistent location

4. **Scan for typos** in multiple locations:
   ```javascript
   // Title: "Implemnt new cache startegy"
   // Should be: "Implement new cache strategy"

   // Code comment with typo
   /**
    * Proccess user authentcation and genrate token
    */
   // Should be: "Process user authentication and generate token"

   // User-facing string
   const message = "Sucessfully saved your prefernces";
   // Should be: "Successfully saved your preferences"
   ```

5. **Smart dictionary checking**:
   - Check against standard English dictionary
   - Check against codebase-specific dictionary
   - If a "typo" appears 3+ times across the codebase → likely valid term, add to dictionary
   - Common false positives: `kubectl`, `repo`, `async`, `webhook`, `OAuth`, custom product names

6. **Post inline suggestions** for detected typos:
   ```markdown
   **Typo Detected**

   ```suggestion
   // Process user authentication and generate token
   ```

   Suggested corrections:
   - "Proccess" → "Process"
   - "authentcation" → "authentication"
   - "genrate" → "generate"
   ```

7. **Update title/description** if typos found:
   - Post a comment suggesting the corrected title/description
   - Example: "Consider updating title: 'Implemnt new cache startegy' → 'Implement new cache strategy'"

8. **Learn from feedback**:
   - If author marks suggestion as "not a typo" or ignores it → add to dictionary
   - Track correction acceptance rate to improve detection accuracy

## Why This Matters

- **Better Communication**: Clear, typo-free code and documentation improve searchability and reduce misunderstandings
- **Smart Learning**: Self-improving dictionary learns codebase terminology to reduce false positives over time
